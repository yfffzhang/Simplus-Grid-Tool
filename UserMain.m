% Read me please:
% Please read the comments in this file carefully, and use this file to run
% toolbox.

%% Tips
%
% Please read manuals in the "Documentations" folder if you want to know
% more details about this tool.
%
% Please ensure that the toolbox is installed first, by running
% "InstallSimplusGT.m" once.
%
% The toolbox defaultly saves the results into Workspace, prints the key
% results in Command Window, and plots key figures.
%
% For changing default user data, please use "UserData.xlsx". More examples
% can be found in "Examples" folder.

%% Clear matlab
clear all;  % Clear Matlab workspace
clc;        % Clear Matlab command window
close all;  % Close all figures, etc

%% Set user data
% Default
% "UserData.xlsx" defaultly contains the data of a 4-bus
% generator-inverter-composite power system. Please feel free to change it.
UserData = 'UserData.xlsm';

% Other example power systems (in "Examples" folder):
%
% Pure ac power system examples:
% UserData = 'SgInfiniteBus.xlsx';              % Single synchronous generator and infinite bus
% UserData = 'GflInverterInfiniteBus.xlsx';   	% Single grid-following inverter and infinite bus
% UserData = 'GfmInverterInfiniteBus.xlsx';   	% Single grid-forming inverter and infinite bus
% UserData = 'IEEE_14Bus.xlsx';
% UserData = 'IEEE_30Bus.xlsx';
% UserData = 'IEEE_57Bus.xlsx';
% UserData = 'NETS_NYPS_68Bus.xlsx';
%
% Pure dc power system examples:
% UserData = 'GfdBuckInfiniteBus.xlsx';         % Single grid-feeding buck converter and infinite bus
%
% Hybrid ac-dc power system examples:
% UserData = 'Hybrid_test_v1.xlsx';             % A 4-bus hybrid ac-dc system

                    % Notes: This model is the minimum realization of
                    % GsysDSS, which keeps the same input and output as
                    % GsysDSS, but reduces the order of state.

% YsysDSS;          % Whole-system admittance model (descriptor state space
                    % form). Notes: This model is derived from GsysDSS by
                    % selecting the voltage and current ports only and
                    % removing other input and output ports.
                    
% ListPowerFlow;    % Power flow
                    % Notes: The result is in the form of
                    % | bus | P | Q | V | angle | omega |
                    % P and Q are in load convention, i.e., the P and Q
                    % flowing from each bus to the active apparatus connected.

% ListPowerFlow_;   % Power flow result for active apparatus only by combing 
                    % the PQ load into the nodal admittance matrix.
